## Why This Exists

Building a game solo with AI is powerful — but a single chat session has no structure. No one stops you from hardcoding magic numbers, skipping design docs, or writing spaghetti code. There's no QA pass, no design review, no one asking "does this actually fit the game's vision?"

**OpenCode PixiJS Game Studio** solves this by giving your AI session the structure of a real studio. Instead of one general-purpose assistant, you get 35 specialized agents organized into a studio hierarchy — directors who guard the vision, department leads who own their domains, and specialists who do the hands-on work. Each agent has defined responsibilities, escalation paths, and quality gates. All running on PixiJS v8 + TypeScript for web browser delivery.

The result: you still make every decision, but now you have a team that asks the right questions, catches mistakes early, and keeps your project organized from first brainstorm to launch.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) (`npm install -g opencode-ai`)
- Python 3 (for JSON validation)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone <repo-url> my-game
cd my-game
npm install                                    # installs PixiJS, Vite, TS + MCP server

# Launch the dev server (browser game)
npm run dev                                    # http://localhost:5173

# Or launch the AI studio
opencode                                       # then run /start to begin
```

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+ and [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) (`npm install -g opencode-ai`).

### Quick Start

Once you're in the OpenCode session:

1. **`/start`** — onboarding flow, asks where you are
2. **`/brainstorm`** — explore game ideas from scratch
3. **`/project-stage-detect`** — if you already have existing work
4. **`/design-system`** — write a game design document for a specific system
5. **`/dev-story`** — implement a story from your sprint

## Upgrading

Already using an older version of this template? See [UPGRADING.md](UPGRADING.md)
for step-by-step migration instructions, a breakdown of what changed between
versions, and which files are safe to overwrite vs. which need a manual merge.

```

## How It Works

### Agent Coordination

Agents follow a structured delegation model:

1. **Vertical delegation** — directors delegate to leads, leads delegate to specialists
2. **Horizontal consultation** — same-tier agents can consult each other but can't make binding cross-domain decisions
3. **Conflict resolution** — disagreements escalate up to the shared parent (`creative-director` for design, `technical-director` for technical)
4. **Change propagation** — cross-department changes are coordinated by `producer`
5. **Domain boundaries** — agents don't modify files outside their domain without explicit delegation

### Collaborative, Not Autonomous

This is **not** an auto-pilot system. Every agent follows a strict collaboration protocol:

1. **Ask** — agents ask questions before proposing solutions
2. **Present options** — agents show 2-4 options with pros/cons
3. **You decide** — the user always makes the call
4. **Draft** — agents show work before finalizing
5. **Approve** — nothing gets written without your sign-off

You stay in control. The agents provide structure and expertise, not autonomy.

### Safety via Permissions

**Permission rules** in `opencode.json` auto-allow safe operations (git status, test runs, reads) and require approval for dangerous ones (force push, `rm -rf`, editing files). This replaces CCGS's hook system.

The following practices are documented in `AGENTS.md` as manual validation steps:
- **Pre-commit validation**: Run `/validate-commit` (check hardcoded values, TODO format)
- **Asset validation**: Run `/validate-assets` after changing asset files
- **Pre-push check**: Run `/validate-push` before pushing to protected branches
- **Session state**: Update `production/session-state/active.md` when starting/stopping work

### Path-Scoped Rules

Coding standards are automatically enforced based on file location:

| Path | Enforces |
|------|----------|
| `src/gameplay/**` | Data-driven values, delta time usage, no UI references |
| `src/core/**` | Zero allocations in hot paths, thread safety, API stability |
| `src/ai/**` | Performance budgets, debuggability, data-driven parameters |
| `src/networking/**` | Server-authoritative, versioned messages, security |
| `src/ui/**` | No game state ownership, localization-ready, accessibility |
| `design/gdd/**` | Required 8 sections, formula format, edge cases |
| `tests/**` | Test naming, coverage requirements, fixture patterns |
| `prototypes/**` | Relaxed standards, README required, hypothesis documented |

## Design Philosophy

This template is grounded in professional game development practices:

- **MDA Framework** — Mechanics, Dynamics, Aesthetics analysis for game design
- **Self-Determination Theory** — Autonomy, Competence, Relatedness for player motivation
- **Flow State Design** — Challenge-skill balance for player engagement
- **Bartle Player Types** — Audience targeting and validation
- **Verification-Driven Development** — Tests first, then implementation

## Customization

This is a **template**, not a locked framework. Everything is meant to be customized:

- **Add/remove agents** — delete agent files you don't need, add new ones for your domains
- **Edit agent prompts** — tune agent behavior, add project-specific knowledge
- **Modify skills** — adjust workflows to match your team's process
- **Add rules** — create new path-scoped rules for your project's directory structure
- **Pick your tech stack** — PixiJS v8 is pre-configured; add Matter.js, Howler.js as needed
- **Set review intensity** — `full` (all director gates), `lean` (phase gates only), or `solo` (none). Set during `/start` or edit `production/review-mode.txt`.

## Platform Support

Primary development and testing on **Windows 11** with PowerShell 7+. OpenCode itself is cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux). This template should work on any platform OpenCode supports.
